REAL ESTATE NFT DAPP 

Blockchain has the potential to  revolutionize every aspect of our online lives and one industry that's primed for disruption in the REAL ESTATE. Blockchain with NFTs and the transfer and sale of properties can be made way more efficient using blockchain and smart contracts. 

This project lists properties online with blockchain and let people buy them directly with their blockchain wallet. The whole process will go through a real estate transaction process called ESCROW where properties are streamlined with NFTs on a blockchain. An escrow is a contractual arrangement in which a third party receives and disburses money or property for the primary transacting parties with the disbusrment dependent on conditions agreed to by the transacting parties.
